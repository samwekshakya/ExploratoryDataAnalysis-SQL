# ExploratoryDataAnalysis-SQL

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project in MySQL utilized the cleaned dataset from the previous Data Cleaning Project to uncover insights and patterns in the data. Key tasks performed include:

1. Aggregate Functions: Applied `MIN()`, `MAX()`, and `SUM()` functions to summarize key metrics and identify data extremes and totals across various variables.
2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Used CTEs to structure complex queries, enhancing readability and enabling reusable subqueries for advanced data exploration.
3. Rolling Total: Calculated rolling totals over specific time periods to analyze trends and understand cumulative metrics across sequential data.
4. Ranking: Implemented ranking functions to categorize and order data based on specific criteria, allowing for performance comparisons and identification of top and bottom entries.

These tasks helped provide a deeper understanding of the data and informed further analysis or modeling.
